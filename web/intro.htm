<h3>About Reinst8</h3>
<p>Reinst8 is a grassroots, non-partisan movement which exists to promote the cause of privacy and defend against
    encroaching censorship. Primarily, we hope to spread the word, to provide and diseminate evidence that the people of
    Britain have been subjected to vicious attacks on civil liberty from multiple agencies such as GCHQ and the NSA.
    Including, but not limited to, secret programmes such as PRISM, Tempora and XKeyscore. By highlighting this
    disturbing phenomenon, we hope to turn apathy into action. We firmly believe that everyone who understands the scope
    of whatâ€™s going on must not sit back and allow it to happen.</p>
